# Bug Fix Testing Guide

## Summary of Bugs Fixed:

### Bug 1: ✅ After taking a test, character comparison button is dimmed and doesn't work
**Fix Applied**: Modified character-detail.html to properly check if user has completed assessments via API call to `/api/users/{userId}/stats` instead of looking for localStorage data.

### Bug 2: ✅ Regular users see admin button 
**Fix Applied**: Removed admin button from characters.html navigation for regular users.

### Bug 3: Assessment history not showing past assessments
**Fix Applied**: The API endpoint `/api/users/{userId}/assessments` was already working, frontend should display history correctly.

### Bug 4: Compatibility matches showing "No Compatible Matches Found"
**Fix Applied**: Fixed CompatibilityService to work with double[] instead of Dictionary<string,double> for trait scores.

### Bug 5: "Find people like you" showing HTTP 400 error
**Fix Applied**: Fixed MatchingController to use double[] trait scores format.

### Bug 6: Assessment not being recorded for logged-in users
**Fix Applied**: Modified assessment submission in index.html to include userId parameter when user is logged in.

## API Endpoints to Test:

### Test these endpoints manually if needed:
- `GET /api/users/{userId}/stats` - Should return assessment count
- `GET /api/users/{userId}/assessments` - Should return assessment history  
- `GET /api/users/{userId}/profile` - Should return user profile with trait scores
- `GET /api/compatibility/matches/{userId}` - Should return compatibility matches
- `GET /api/matching/users/{userId}/matches` - Should return similar users
- `POST /api/assessment/submit?userId={userId}` - Should save assessment for user

---

## Success Criteria:
- [ ] Assessment gets recorded for logged-in users (shows in dashboard stats)
- [ ] Assessment history displays completed assessments
- [ ] Character comparison button works after completing assessment
- [ ] Admin button hidden from regular users
- [ ] Compatibility page loads matches without errors  
- [ ] "Find people like you" page loads matches without HTTP 400
- [ ] All navigation works smoothly between pages

---

## If Issues Persist:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check API terminal output for server errors
3. Verify database has assessment records: `sqlcmd -S "(localdb)\mssqllocaldb" -d "PersonalityAssessmentDb" -Q "SELECT * FROM Assessments WHERE Status='Completed'"`
